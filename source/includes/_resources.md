## Approval Guidelines

Once you’ve registered for a developer account, you’ll be put into a queue to be considered for a production API key. Below you’ll find some guidelines for getting approved.

* Provide accurate app name and contact information.
* Provide detailed description of what you’re building.
* Supply estimated processing volume and markets.
* Provide valid payment information.

Here are some good use cases for the API:

* Travel agency who wants to offer an extra service to their customers.
* Travel technology company who wants to implement travel authorizations in their web and mobile properties.
* Government agencies that wants to build an analytics tool.

You will most likely not be approved for a production key in these scenarios:

* You need mainly updated info on travel authorizations, rather than creating new documents.
* You’re building a copy of or competitor to SimpleVisa.
* Your use case violates our [Terms of Use](#).
